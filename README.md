# youtube-downloader

## About the Project

This simple application was made in a couple hours after I identified a need to download and store youtube videos locally on my computer. As a fan of interactive applications, I chose to make a GUI app as opposed to a console-only app. This project is not polished to perfection and there's plenty of room for feature and presentation improvement. However, a solid foundation is there.

This project was created for Windows.
